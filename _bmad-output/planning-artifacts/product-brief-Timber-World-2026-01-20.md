# Product Brief: Timber World Platform

## Executive Summary

Timber World is a "Production Orchestrator" - a company that owns and controls timber through the entire supply chain, coordinating production across owned and partner facilities to deliver quality wood products to B2B customers across Europe.

**The Problem:** With a 3-person team managing suppliers, producers, and clients entirely through email, WhatsApp, phone calls, and Google Sheets, Timber World has hit a scaling ceiling. Every order - regardless of size - requires the same manual workflow: quotation, purchase order, contract, signature collection, production order, and producer coordination. This consumes 90% of team time, makes small orders uneconomical, and creates a growth trap where more business requires more headcount before generating more revenue. Salespeople spend their time on administrative tasks instead of finding and nurturing clients.

**The Solution:** The Timber World Platform - a B2B supply chain system that automates operational workflows and provides self-service portals for all parties. Suppliers, producers, clients, and salespeople interact directly with the platform, eliminating manual communication bottlenecks. The system handles quotes, orders, production tracking, inventory, documents, and payments - freeing the team to focus on sales and network expansion.

**The Outcome:** Scale from dozens to hundreds of partners and clients without proportional headcount growth. Transform small orders from a burden into viable business. Achieve complete visibility and control while reducing operational effort by 90%. Enable salespeople to focus on selling, not administration.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Timber World operates as a production orchestrator, managing the flow of timber from suppliers through production facilities to B2B clients. The current operational model relies entirely on manual communication (email, WhatsApp, phone) and fragmented tools (Google Sheets, Google Drive) to coordinate this supply chain.

Every client order triggers a cascade of manual tasks:
1. Create and send quotation
2. Prepare purchase order for supplier
3. Draft contract specification
4. Update tracking spreadsheets
5. Send documents for signature
6. Receive signed documents
7. Create production order
8. Send production order to producer
9. Track progress via messages
10. Coordinate delivery and documentation

This same workflow executes whether the order is worth €500 or €50,000 - making small orders economically unviable and large orders administratively overwhelming.

**Salespeople are trapped:** Instead of finding new clients and growing relationships, they spend their time creating manual quotes, chasing signatures, tracking orders, and following up on production status. The lack of a unified system means data is scattered, tasks are easily forgotten, and errors creep in.

### Problem Impact

- **Time consumed:** 90% of team capacity goes to repetitive operational tasks
- **Scaling blocked:** Cannot grow beyond current partner/client base without adding headcount
- **Small orders rejected:** Fixed overhead per order makes small business uneconomical
- **Errors inevitable:** Manual data entry across multiple systems introduces mistakes
- **Visibility limited:** No real-time view of inventory, production status, or order progress
- **Wasted effort:** When production fails or orders cancel, all manual preparation is lost
- **Growth trap:** More orders → more people needed → higher costs → need even more orders
- **Sales inefficiency:** Salespeople do admin instead of selling; no single system for CRM, quotes, and order tracking

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

**Current approach (manual + spreadsheets):**
- Every action requires human effort
- No automation of repetitive workflows
- No self-service for partners or clients
- Data scattered across email, sheets, and chat histories
- No real-time visibility into operations
- Salespeople must manually track their pipeline and activities

**Generic ERP systems:**
- Built for traditional manufacturing, not production orchestration
- Don't handle the "orchestrator" model (coordinating external facilities)
- Complex, expensive, and designed for larger organizations
- Don't provide partner/client self-service portals
- CRM usually separate or poorly integrated

**Standalone CRM systems (like Pipedrive):**
- Good for pipeline tracking
- But disconnected from inventory, quotes, orders, production
- Salespeople still need to jump between systems
- No visibility into what happens after the sale

**No existing solution** addresses the specific needs of a timber production orchestrator managing a network of external suppliers and producers while serving B2B clients - with integrated sales tools.

### Proposed Solution

**The Timber World Platform** - a purpose-built B2B supply chain system with:

1. **Unified Portal Architecture**
   - One portal application with function-based access
   - **Clients** see ordering, tracking, invoices
   - **Suppliers** see orders, deliveries, payments
   - **Producers** see production orders, inventory, efficiency
   - **Sales** see CRM, quotes, client orders, pipeline
   - **Admins** see everything with full control
   - Multi-role users supported (same person can have multiple roles)

2. **Automated Workflows**
   - Client quote request → automatic pricing (where possible)
   - Approved quote → automatic PO to supplier
   - Materials received → automatic production order
   - Production complete → automatic client notification
   - Documents (invoices, CMRs, packing lists) generated automatically

3. **Self-Service for All Parties**
   - Clients: browse catalog, reorder, track shipments, view invoices
   - Suppliers: confirm orders, report deliveries, submit invoices
   - Producers: accept jobs, report progress, log material usage
   - Sales: create quotes, manage pipeline, track client orders

4. **Integrated Sales & CRM**
   - Full CRM functionality built into the platform (replaces Pipedrive)
   - Pipeline tracking with deals and stages
   - Contact management with communication history
   - Email integration (Gmail) for tracking all correspondence
   - Activity logging (calls, meetings, follow-ups)
   - Quote creation connected to real inventory and pricing
   - Order status visible without chasing operations

5. **Complete Visibility**
   - Real-time inventory at all locations
   - Production status and efficiency metrics
   - Cost tracking and margin analysis
   - Quality documentation with photos
   - Sales performance and pipeline analytics

### Key Differentiators

1. **Built for Production Orchestrators**
   - Designed for companies that coordinate rather than own all production
   - Handles the complexity of external supplier and producer networks
   - Supports entry/exit at any production stage

2. **Platform as Partner Advantage**
   - System so good that suppliers and producers prefer working with Timber World
   - Better technology than partners have internally
   - Transparency and efficiency benefit all parties

3. **Automation-First Design**
   - Default is automatic; human intervention is the exception
   - Small orders viable because system effort is near-zero
   - Team freed for high-value activities (sales, relationships, quality)

4. **Sales-Operations Integration**
   - CRM, quotes, orders, and production in ONE system
   - Salespeople see order status without asking operations
   - No data re-entry or system jumping
   - Pipeline connected to real inventory and delivery timelines

5. **Single Source of Truth**
   - One database, multiple interfaces
   - No more scattered spreadsheets and email threads
   - Real-time accuracy across all parties

6. **Phased, Practical Approach**
   - MVP focused on highest-pain production tracking
   - Build value incrementally, not big-bang deployment
   - Learn and adapt as real usage reveals needs
