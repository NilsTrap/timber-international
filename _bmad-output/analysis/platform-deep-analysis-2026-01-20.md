## Area 1: Business Model

### 1.1 Revenue Streams

| Stream | Description | Share |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Production Margin** | Buy logs → Process through factories → Sell finished goods | ~50% |
| **Trading Margin** | Buy finished goods from external sources → Resell to clients | ~50% |
| **Platform Fees** | None - platform is FREE for partners | 0% |

**Key Insight:** All transactions are buy/sell. Timber World takes ownership of goods at each stage. No commission model.

### 1.2 Supply Chain Model

**Timber World is a "Production Orchestrator"** - controls quality and accountability throughout the supply chain without necessarily owning all production facilities.

#### What Timber World OWNS:
- Raw materials (logs, timber at every stage)
- Customer relationships
- Brand and reputation
- Quality standards

#### What Timber World CONTROLS:
- Production schedules
- Quality inspection
- Pricing
- Which factory does what

#### What Timber World PAYS FOR:
- Raw materials from suppliers
- Processing services from factories

#### What Timber World DOESN'T OWN:
- All factories - mix of owned, partner, and outsourced

### 1.3 Production Flow

**Entry and exit can happen at ANY stage:**

│    Factories: Can do MULTIPLE stages                                    │
│    Ownership: Doesn't matter (owned/partner/outsourced = same portal)   │
│                                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Production Stages:**
1. **LOGS** - Bought from logging companies
2. **SAWMILL** - Logs cut into lumber/boards
3. **KILNS** - Drying the wood
4. **PANELS** - Gluing boards into panels (FJ or FS), or beams
5. **MACHINING** - CNC, cutting to shapes/dimensions, other machining
6. **FINISHING** - Varnishing, lacquering, oiling

**Important Notes:**
- Stages can be mixed or excluded
- Not all products go through all stages
- Single factory can do multiple stages
- Can enter supply chain at any stage (buy logs, boards, kiln-dried, panels, etc.)
- Can exit at any stage (sell boards, panels, finished products)

### 1.4 Current Scale

| Factory Type | Count | Status |
|--------------|-------|--------|
| Sawmills | ~2 | Outsourced |
| Kilns/Drying | ~2 | Outsourced |
| Panel Manufacturing | ~2 | Outsourced |
| CNC/Machining | (included above) | Outsourced |
| Finishing | (included above) | Outsourced |

**Future:** Some may become partners, but portal functionality remains the same regardless of ownership status.

### 1.5 Trading Rationale

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Capacity** | Trade volume + production volume = larger total business |
| **Risk mitigation** | Not 100% dependent on own production |
| **Specialty items** | Products Timber World doesn't make or are expensive to make |
| **NOT geography** | Everything goes through warehouse for quality check anyway |

### 1.6 The Scaling Bottleneck (Current Problem)

| Client + Supplier | Sawmill buys logs from TW, sells boards to TW |
| Client + Producer | Factory produces for TW, also buys materials for own production |
| Supplier + Producer | Sawmill supplies boards AND does kiln drying as a service |

**Decision:** One user can have multiple roles, sees all their functions combined.

### 2.9 Portal Architecture Decision

**DECISION: Option B - One Portal, Function-Based Access**

After analysis, decided on ONE portal application for all users:

```
apps/
├── marketing/        ← Public website (no login)
└── portal/           ← ONE portal for ALL users
                        Function-based permissions per user
```

**Rationale:**
- Simpler codebase (one app to maintain)
- Handles multi-role users naturally
- Consistent UI pattern everywhere
- Flexible permissions system
- Easier updates and maintenance

**UI Pattern:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TIMBER WORLD PORTAL                               [User Menu ▼] │
├────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

│  Only shows│                                                     │
│  functions │                                                     │

└────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Permission Model:**

```
USER
├── Has one or more ROLES (client, supplier, producer, admin)
│
└── Each ROLE has FUNCTIONS that can be toggled ON/OFF
    │
    └── Each FUNCTION may have SUB-PERMISSIONS
        (e.g., view only vs edit, limited data vs full data)
```

---

## Design Principles Discovered

### Principle #1: UNIFORMITY (Stage-Agnostic & Ownership-Agnostic)

The platform must handle all stages and ownership types with the same interfaces.

| What | Principle |
|------|-----------|
| **Suppliers** | Same portal regardless of what stage they supply |
| **Producers** | Same portal regardless of owned/partner/outsourced |
| **Products** | Same data structure regardless of processing stage |
| **Sales** | Same interface regardless of what's being sold |

### Principle #2: FEATURE-BASED ACCESS (All Portals)

Not just Admin - ALL portals have toggleable features per user/company.

```
Features can be:
├── Always ON (basic features)
├── Toggleable per client/supplier/producer type
├── Priority ordered (required vs optional fields)
└── Customizable per organization
```

### Principle #3: REPLACE THEIR SYSTEMS

The platform should be so good that partners USE IT instead of their own internal systems.

**Value Proposition:** Timber World provides partners with better technology than they have internally, making them want to work with Timber World.

### Principle #4: MULTI-LEVEL ACCESS WITHIN ORGANIZATIONS

Each company can have multiple users with different access levels:

```
SUPPLIER COMPANY
├── Owner/Manager → Full access: orders, invoices, payments
├── Sales Contact → Orders, communication, delivery
└── Production Manager → Order details, quality specs (NO financials)
```

### Principle #5: QUALITY DOCUMENTATION IS CENTRAL

Photos and specifications flow both directions between all parties.

```
Upload: Production photos, quality evidence
Download: Quality specifications, reference photos, acceptance criteria
Confirm: Mutual agreement that specs are understood
```

### Principle #6: ONE PORTAL, FUNCTION-BASED ACCESS

One portal application serves all user types. Users see functions based on their roles and permissions.

```
ONE PORTAL APP
├── Client logs in → sees Client functions
├── Supplier logs in → sees Supplier functions
├── Producer logs in → sees Producer functions
├── Admin logs in → sees Admin functions
└── Multi-role user → sees combined functions from all their roles

Benefits:
├── Simple codebase (one app)
├── Multi-role users work naturally
├── Consistent UI everywhere
├── Flexible permission system
└── Easier maintenance
```

### Principle #7: RESTful API ARCHITECTURE

Backend and frontend are separated via RESTful API for maximum flexibility.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                         BACKEND                                  │
│                                                                  │
│    Supabase Database + RESTful API Layer                        │
│                                                                  │
└─────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘

│   (Next.js)   │   │  (iOS/Android)│   │  (partners?)  │
└───────────────┘   └───────────────┘   └───────────────┘

Benefits:
├── Clean separation of concerns
├── Can build mobile apps using same API
├── Can build additional frontends easily
├── Third-party integrations possible
└── Different teams can work independently
```

### 3.3 Product Transformation Model

**Decision: Option B - New products created at each stage**

When products are processed, INPUT products are consumed and OUTPUT products are created.

```
PRODUCTION TRANSFORMATION

INPUT (consumed):
├── Product: Oak Board (wet)
├── Quantity: 10 m³
└── Status: CONSUMED

OUTPUT (created):
├── Product: Oak Board (kiln-dried)  ← NEW PRODUCT
├── Quantity: 9.5 m³
└── Waste/Loss: 0.5 m³ tracked
```

**Benefits:**
- Full traceability (what went in, what came out)
- Track losses/waste at each stage
- Accurate cost calculation per stage
- Quality tracking per production batch

### 3.4 Inventory Location Model

**Decision: Track inventory at ALL locations**

| Location Type | Examples | Tracked |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| Timber World Warehouses | Main warehouse, regional (2-3) | ✅ Yes |
| Supplier Locations | Each supplier's yard/warehouse | ✅ Yes |
| Producer Facilities | Each factory's storage area | ✅ Yes |
| In Transit | Trucks between locations | ✅ Yes |

```
INVENTORY STRUCTURE

Organization
└── Location (Warehouse/Yard/Facility)
    └── Inventory Items
        ├── Product A: 50 m³
        ├── Product B: 120 pieces
        └── Product C: 30 m²

MOVEMENT TRACKING
Location A ──(Movement + CMR)──► Location B
```

### 3.5 Units of Measure

**Decision:** Units are flexible, admin can add more.

| Unit | Code | Used For |
|------|------|----------|
| Cubic meters | m³ | Logs, boards, large volumes |
| Pieces | pcs | Individual items, panels |
| Square meters | m² | Panels by surface area |
| Running meters | rm | Handrails, strips, long items |
| Package | pkg | Bundled items |
| *(admin can add more)* | | |

**Important:** Buy and sell can use DIFFERENT units (e.g., buy per m³, sell per piece).

### 3.6 Order Flow

**Two paths depending on inventory:**

```
PATH A: FROM STOCK
1. Client places order
2. TW confirms order
3. Check inventory → Available
4. Shipment created
5. Delivery + CMR
6. Invoice sent
7. Payment received

PATH B: NEEDS PRODUCTION
1. Client places order
2. TW confirms order
3. Check inventory → Not available
4. Create Production Order to Producer
5. Producer manufactures
6. Shipment: Producer → TW Warehouse
7. ★ QUALITY CONTROL at TW ★
8. Shipment: TW → Client
9. Delivery + CMR
10. Invoice sent
11. Payment received
```

**Key Insight:** Quality control happens at TW warehouse before shipping to client.

### 3.7 Pricing Model

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Standard Price List** | Yes, for stock and production items |
| **Custom Prices** | Yes, per client (history/relationship based) |
| **Price Units** | m³, piece, m², running meter (product-dependent) |
| **Buy vs Sell Units** | Can differ |
| **Volume Discounts** | Possible, small quantity surcharge used |
| **Delivery Terms** | Mostly EXW, some DAP |
| **Price Stability** | 1-2x per year changes (sometimes 3 years unchanged) |

```
PRICING STRUCTURE

Standard Prices (baseline)
├── Product A: €250/m³ or €45/piece
└── Product B: €280/m³

Client-Specific Prices (overrides)
├── Client X: Product A at €240/m³
└── Client Y: Product A + DAP included

Additional Charges
├── Small quantity surcharge
├── Delivery cost (if not DAP)
